# Resident Evil Village PC Mouse Cursor Fix
Resident Evil Village on PC shows a visible mouse cursor, that moves around while your move the player's camera, when certain resolutions are selected, such as ultrawide resolutions or lower 5:4 resolutions, such as my monitor's 1280x1024.

It is a very annoying and pressing issue, that is quite distracting and detrimental to the games playability. This is a simple Python Script to fix that issue. It works by utilizing Ducky Script converted to Python, to open the mouse settings and automatically changing the cursor to an invisible one, the resorting back to the default cursor once the game is closed.
